### On the scene you have to create an empty object and add two scripts "GridRenderer" (will be added later) that render game grid. Places where a player can't move are marked with red color. Empty zones are marked with white color, players â€” green.  You have to add two prefabs to component with simple mesh to render grid. Script "Main" (will be added later) is the main script in which all classes and dependencies are created. You can open the menu of the "Main" component and call all main functions: "Restart", "Set Obstacle" and "Move (Side)"
